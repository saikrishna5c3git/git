GIVEN TASK-- CRUD OPERATIONS ON FOOD BOOKING IN IRCTC WEBSITE

I have written a program for CRUD OPERATIONS on IRCTC food booking. 
In this i have created class of name "irctc".
I have defined some functions which are useful for the user as per their requirements such as accept,display,delete,update, search.
In this i used a while loop to ask the user to ask the specific operation to be performed everytime util the user wants to exit.
In this exit() is used to come out of the loop.
if else clauses are used to make the specific operation as per the user requirement.
I also posted the screenshots of the output regarding the program and every operation has been executed.
